  ## GRAND-POTENTIAL MODEL 


  ## CAHN HILLIARD MODEL
     * C code for precipitate evolution. 
     * It solves Allen-Cahn and Cahnâ€“Hilliard equations using FFTW3.  
     * Compile the code using "make". Compilation creates "FFT_2D_ppt.out" file. 
     * Execute "./FFT_2D_ppt Input.in Filling.in output" 

     * Authors: Dasari Mohan and M P Gururajan

     * This is alpha version of the code and check for updates in future release.

  ## KKS GPU CUDA MODEL
  This code solves the problem of precipitate growth using a multiphase field solver on the GPU.
  The code is tested on Tesla P100 and Tesla V100.
  For Tesla K80, one needs to comment "CudaMemPrefetchAsync" in solverloop/evolve.h

  To run the code use 
  1. "make" to create executable kks.out
  2. Execute "./kks.out Input.in Filling.in Output"

  The code uses CUDA version 11, CUFFT and CUDA-CUB libraries. 
  nvcc version 11.2 is used for compilation of the codes.
  Input.in contains all numerical and physical parameters used in the simulations. 
  Makefile creates a  DATA folder where the datafiles (in the form of VTK files) are stored.
  VTK files can be viewed using Paraview.

  This is the alpha version of code. We will continue to add more features in future release.

  ## KKS GPU OPENCL MODEL

   * OpenCL code for solidification microstructure evolution 

   * Compile the code using "make". Compilation creates "kim_soldfn.out" file. 
   * GEdata_writer.py is used for generation of Gibbs energy and its derivatives
   * To generate Gibbs energies and execute the program
   * run "./kimsldfn.sh  Input.in Filling.in Output"
   * It is always safe to run above command for execution of the code.

   * If Gibbs energies are generated already then generating 
   * Gibbs energies can be skipped and directly execute following command.
   * Execute "./kim_soldfn.out Input.in Filling.in Output"
